- 2.1.0

* Eject button now cycles between media players.
* When media player exits (and wmusic is run without the -R option), wmusic

* Various bug fixes, including some memory leaks.

- 2.0.0
* Now maintained by the Window Maker Team.
* Remove debian directory, spec file, and generated autotools files.
* Remove libdockapp directory; we will used shared lib.
* Modernize autotools files.
* Remove version.h header file; use autoconf's PACKAGE_STRING instead.
* Update location of libdockapp header file.
* Port to playerctl for MPRIS support.
  Since development on XMMS ended long ago (last release was in 2007), we have
  switched support to MPRIS (Media Player Remote Interfacing Specification),
  an API for controlling *any* media player which supports it.  We use the
  playerctl C library, available from https://github.com/acrisci/playerctl.
  Because of the switch, several more XMMS-specific features have been removed.
  In particular,
  + The channels are no longer displayed, and the volume is always displayed.
  + The bitrate is no longer displayed, and the title is always displayed.
  + The eject feature no longer is functional, although the eject button is
    still present.
  + Toggling between the various XMMS windows is no longer supported.
* Fix incompatible pointer types.
* Fix display bug; print entire title for short titles.
  Previously, if a title was too short to require scrolling, the first
  character was omitted.
* Remove unsupported command line options.
* Print message when connecting to new player.
* Fix volume display bug.
  The black pixels which were copied to the right part of the volume slider
  when the volume was decreased actually included a one-pixel-wide line of the
  bright red indicating max volume.
* Remove trailing whitespace.
* Separate changelog into its own file.
* Add manpage (adapted from Debian).
* Update documentation and help text.
* Include all necessary header files.
* Add desktop file.
